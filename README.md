Teststack is a collection of bash scripts based on devstack and some OpenStack tutorials to deploy OpenStack in an automated and easy way.

Currently this script requires Ubuntu 12.04+

What is working(for the most part):
	Keystone
	Glance
	Cinder
	Swift

Other services such as Heat and Ceilometer are not a high priority
